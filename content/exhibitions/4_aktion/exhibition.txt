Text:

This group exhibition examines issues of accent, body language, gestures, and ways of dressing. It will look at how these components act as a way of both relating to people, and the way of making decisions, in politics.

It also investigates how impactful the body of populist selfpresentation within its leaders as a mode of identification. The exhibition’s title, The body speaks before it even talks, is based on a recently published article by Spanish political theorist, María Esperanza Casullo, who establishes that “bodily self-presentation informs how affect, identification and political representation are established even before words are spoken.” Taking Casullo’s title and approach to “deliberation theory” as a prompt, the exhibition will examine the body of populist self-presentation within its leaders as a mode of identification
