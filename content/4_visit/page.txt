There are two automatic-door entrances to the building, which give direct access to Cathedral Arcade and the buildingâ€™s three elevators. Building Entrance 1 is on Swanston Street and is at street level, Building Entrance 2 is on Flinders Lane via some steps.

Blindside is on the seventh floor in Rooms 13 and 14. When exiting the elevator at Level 7, turn right and go through the glass door furthest from the elevators. Blindside is located at the end of this corridor. The Nicholas Building does not have a wheelchair-accessible toilet on-site. The closest accessible toilets can be found on the ground floor at City Library on Flinders Lane. Support dogs and other animals are welcome - please note, they will need to be kept on a leash at all times. The closest tram stop is Town Hall/Collins St, which services a number of trams. There are on-street disabled parking bays along Flinders Lane.

If you have additional accessibility questions or require tailored support, don't hesitate to email info@blindside.org.au
