In 2022, 99% was a year-long schedule of exhibitions, public programs, texts, and conversations that untangle the complex connections between populism and contemporary art, staged in a dedicated gallery space in the Nicholas Building in Melbourneâ€™s CBD, and with a public-facing online platform.

The gallery is run by Chelsea Hopper.
