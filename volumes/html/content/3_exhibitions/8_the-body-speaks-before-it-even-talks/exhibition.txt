Text: *The body speaks before it even talks* takes its title from the work of political scientist, María Esperanza Casullo, referring to the public image that populists fabricate in order to identify themselves with “the people”. Treating this self-design as a performative enterprise, the exhibition looks at the body language of populism—its fashions, gestures, and unspoken languages.
