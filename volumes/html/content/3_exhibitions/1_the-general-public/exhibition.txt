Text:

The General Public is an “open call” for the general public to submit an artwork to be on display for two weeks. Publicly promoted to artists and non-artists alike, the exhibition invites the public to contribute a work—there is no entry fee and only two conditions of entry: one work per person can be submitted and the scale of the work is limited to a size that fits under one’s arm.

This exhibition concept is not without precedent. Famously, the New York-based Society of Independent Artists invited in 1916 the public to submit any work, subject to no aesthetic criteria, provided that the $5 membership was paid. That exhibition led to the great twentieth-century scandal in which R. Mutt’s Fountain (aka Duchamp’s urinal) was rejected. Decades later, Walter Hopps’s 1978 exhibition, 36 Hours, had a similar framework. There was no selection, no rules; artists were invited to bring one work and have it exhibited for 36 hours.
