Text:

Richard Bell is a founding member of the Brisbane-based arts collective proppaNOW. Since 2013, Bell has gained international recognition for his homage to the Aboriginal tent embassy in Canberra in his work *Embassy *(2013–ongoing). The work has hosted talks and performances by artists, activists, and thinkers in Moscow, New York, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Amsterdam, Sydney, the Venice Biennale and, in 2023, at the Tate Modern, London. This year Bell is also one of a few Australian-based artists presenting at documenta 15 in Kassel, Germany.

While Bell has described himself as an activist masquerading as an artist, RICH presents Bell as an artist masquerading as a populist. The exhibition probes the dynamics of Bell’s populist persona in a series of text-based works produced between 2003 and 2020.

The paintings and prints on show in RICH sloganize populist sentiment under the cover of pop art and abstract-expressionist style. Bell’s ironic quips sneak in questions of power, colonialism, and capitalism. Steering away from the divisive populism we know, RICH asks us to imagine an alternate populism that counters the usually destructive forces of populist racism, greed, and selfishness.
